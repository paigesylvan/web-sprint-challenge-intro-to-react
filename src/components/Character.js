// Write your Character component here
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

//1. Build a React component named 'Character' to render an individual character.
//1. Map over the list in state, and for each character render a Character to the page.
//1. Each rendered character must display its name in the DOM (e.g. "Luke Skywalker").
//1. The character's name can't be hard-coded into the HTML. This data must be obtained from the API.
//1. The components must be styled with **styled-components**.

const Character = (props) => {

const {characters} = props

return (
    <div className='individual-containter'>

    </div>
)

//gender: "male",
//height: "172",
//mass: "77",
